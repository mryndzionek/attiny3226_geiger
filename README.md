# ATtiny low power Geiger counter

The goal of this project is to design a Geiger counter and
continuous radiation monitor in one device. This means two things:
 - low energy consumption, so batteries last for months of continuous monitoring
 - a display capable of displaying exact instantaneous radiation levels

Nice to have things:
 - measurement history (at least 10 minutes)
 - cumulative dose

## More info

The average current consumption with display turned off is ~200uA.
A set of 3 AAA batteries should last more than a year.
